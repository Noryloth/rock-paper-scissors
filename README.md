Rock Paper Scissors project

In this project I tried to create rock paper scissors game in browser console using JavaScript.

[Pseudocode]

1. When a user inputs a character (r, p or s).
2. Check if its an appropriate character.
3. If yes, save user's choice. Else show error message.
4. Reference 1-3 numbers to r, p and s characters.
5. Generate a random number between 1 and 3 for computer's choice.
6. Check who is the winner.
7. Show result message.

[After finishing project]

I know that pseudocode looks bad and doesn't actually fit the code. But it has still helped me anyway.
